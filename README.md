# AI_Peer Ed-Tech Platform
Ed-Tech Platform for Active Retention Learning

Welcome to our Ed-Tech Platform for Active Retention Learning! This platform aims to revolutionize how students learn and retain information through spaced repetition, BERT-based text generation, summarization, similarity checking, and question-answering capabilities. Our app uses Flutter for the front-end, Django for the back-end, and Transformers for natural language processing tasks.

### Demo of our App

### Features

1. Spaced Repetition: Our platform utilizes the spaced repetition technique to optimize learning and memory retention. Users will encounter the same concepts at gradually increasing intervals to reinforce their knowledge effectively.

2. BERT-based Text Generator: The BERT-based generator empowers users to create coherent and contextually relevant text in a given domain. It can generate essays, articles, or creative writing prompts.

3. Summarizer: The summarization feature allows users to extract concise summaries from lengthy texts, making it easier to grasp the main points quickly.

4. Similarity Checker: Users can compare two pieces of text to determine their semantic similarity, helping them identify overlaps or similarities between texts.

5. Question-Answering Model: The platform leverages a powerful question-answering model to provide accurate and relevant answers to user queries based on provided context.

6. Flashcards Creation: Users can create personalized decks of cards containing different learning materials, making it convenient to review and study specific topics.

### Technologies Used

1. Flutter: The front-end of our app is built using Flutter, a popular UI toolkit for creating natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop.

2. Django: Our back-end is developed using Django, a high-level Python web framework that enables the smooth handling of API requests and data processing.

3. Transformers: We employ the Transformers library, built on top of Hugging Face's state-of-the-art models, for natural language processing tasks such as text generation, summarization, and question-answering.

4. Heroku: We have deployed our Django backend on Heroku to serve API requests for seamless integration with our app.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/utkarsh-iitbhu/edtech-platform.git

2. Set up the back-end: Follow the instructions in the backend/README.md file to set up the Django back-end and deploy it on Heroku.

3. Set up the front-end: Follow the instructions in the frontend/README.md file to set up and run the Flutter front-end on your device.

Ensure the necessary dependencies are installed: Refer to the requirements files in the respective backend and frontend directories for required packages.

### Usage
* Upon launching the app, users can sign up or log in to access the various features of the Ed-Tech Platform.

* Users can create decks, add learning materials, and organize them into subjects or categories for structured studying.

* To generate text, summarize content, check similarity, or seek answers to questions, users can input the relevant text and trigger the respective NLP tasks.

* The spaced repetition system will present flashcards or learning materials at optimal intervals to maximize retention.

### Future Enhancements
* User Progress Tracking: Implement a feature to track users' learning progress and provide insights into their performance.

* Collaborative Learning: Introduce collaborative learning features, such as study groups and discussions.

* Enhanced Spaced Repetition: Refine the spaced repetition algorithm for more personalized and adaptive learning experiences.

Thank you for choosing our Ed-Tech Platform for Active Retention Learning. We hope this platform enhances your learning experience and knowledge retention journey! Happy learning!
